ðŸ“– Overview
Component

Technology

Role

Protocol

gRPC / Protocol Buffers

Defines service interfaces and data structures (clinic.proto).

Server

Python (server.py)

Listens on 0.0.0.0:50051, handles RPCs, and manages the central database.

Database

SQLite (clinic.db)

Single source of truth for all data, located on the Server Host machine.

Client

Python (client.py)

Connects to the Server Host's specific IP to execute CRUD operations.

ðŸš€ Setup & Installation (Mandatory Steps for All Users)
These steps must be completed from the ROOT directory (/clinicSystem).

1. Project Structure
Ensure your file structure matches this diagram to avoid Python import errors:

/clinicSystem
â”œâ”€â”€ .venv/
â”œâ”€â”€ citesys/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ client.py
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ clinic.proto
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ server.py
â””â”€â”€ requirements.txt

2. Virtual Environment & Dependencies
Activate the environment before running any scripts.

# Create the environment
python -m venv .venv

# Activate (Use 'source .venv/Scripts/activate' on MINGW64/Git Bash)
source .venv/Scripts/activate

Install all necessary packages:

(venv) pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Generate gRPC Code Stubs
This command compiles the service definition (clinic.proto) into the Python files required by the server and client. Must be run from the ROOT.

(venv) python -m grpc_tools.protoc -I citesys --python_out=citesys --pyi_out=citesys --grpc_python_out=citesys citesys/clinic.proto

(Success will be silent. Two new files: clinic_pb2.py and clinic_pb2_grpc.py will appear in citesys/.)

ðŸŽ¯ Role-Based Instructions
A. Server Host Machine
The Server Host must perform the following actions to make the central service available on the network.

1. Network Configuration
The Server binds to the wildcard IP (0.0.0.0), but the operating system firewall must be configured:

Action: Create an inbound rule to allow TCP traffic on port 50051.

2. Start the Server
Run the server executable from the ROOT directory:

(venv) python citesys/server.py

The server will start listening immediately.

3. Share Host IP
The client needs the host's actual local IP address (e.g., 192.168.1.55). The server should be running before you check your IP.

Action: Find and share your current IP address (using ipconfig or ip a).

B. Client User Machine
The Client User runs the application that consumes the data and logic provided by the Server Host.

1. Update Client IP
Before running, update the connection string in the client code (citesys/client.py) with the IP shared by the Server Host.

# Inside citesys/client.py
class ClinicClient:
    def __init__(self):
        # REPLACE 'SERVER_HOST_IP' with the actual IP address provided by the Server Host
        self.channel = grpc.insecure_channel('SERVER_HOST_IP:50051') 
        self.stub = clinic_pb2_grpc.ClinicServiceStub(self.channel)

2. Run the Client
Execute the client application from the ROOT directory:

(venv) python citesys/client.py

The client will connect, send RPCs, and display the results, which are all stored centrally on the Server Host's clinic.db file.
